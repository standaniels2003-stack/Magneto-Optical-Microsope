# Code

This folder contains all scripts, notebooks, and simulations for the FELIX internship.

## Folder Structure:

```bash
Code/                   # scripts, notebooks, simulatios
│
├── Analysis/           # Experiment-specifieke analyses
│
├── Simulations/        # Theoretical or Simulation code
│
├── src/                # Core helper modules / reusable functions
│
├── README.md           # Explanation of code folder structure and dependencies
└── requirements.txt    # pip dependencies for venv
```

## Setup Virtual Environment

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate it:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r Code/requirements.txt
   ```

## How Code Connects to the Experiments/ Folder

All data analysis scripts assume the following directory layout:

- **Raw data** is loaded from:
    ```bash
   Experiments/<experiment>/Raw_Data/
   ```
- **Processed data** is saved to:
    ```bash
   Experiments/<experiment>/Processed_Data/
   ```
- **Figures** generated by scripts are stored in:
    ```bash
   Experiments/<experiment>/Figures/
   ```
