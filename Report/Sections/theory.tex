\section{Theory}
Purpose: Provide the physics necessary to understand your experiment and results.\\
Content:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relevant physics concepts (e.g., magnetism, optics, thermodynamics)
    \item Equations and models used for predictions or data analysis
    \item Definitions of key quantities, units, and conventions
    \item Any approximations or assumptions made
\end{itemize}
Tips: Use figures or schematics to illustrate models if needed. Keep it directly relevant to your experiment.
